_These are notes from the lecture "The Ideological Attack Upon Salafiyyah" by Shaykh Abu Iyaad._

Islam isn't an ideology. It is wahy.

Ideologies → fikr & kalaam & ra’ī - used to undermine islam.

# Introduction

- salafiyyah is islam and islam is salafiyyah

*that is what the sahaabah were upon and this religion will be preserved by Allah*

- division of religion into usool and furoo’ is a false principle.

*saying that beliefs are from the usool and rest is from furoo’ is wrong. you can leave ahlus-sunnah by a practical matter just like you can leave it with a matter of belief… check usool-us-sunnah, sharh-us-sunnah etc.*

- manhaj and aqeedah are connected

*example of those who ibn Abbas found doing innovated dhikr. they were killed fighting alongside the khawaarij on the day of nahrawan*

- Ideas live longer than men

*even the kuffar are ruling by ideas of Plato and Aristotle. Salaf knew this and hence were severely harsh with mubtadi’yoon. Still we have those ibtidaa’ of old.*

- bid’ah comes in waves

*like the jahmiyyah first said that quran is created and then started saying that their recitation of quran is created… both statements are of kufr*

- at any given time all of the ulamah combined have refuted all the falsehood

*every Muslim has good in him. but if we abandon the principle of accepting the refutation of a scholar against an bid’ee saying others have praised him or remained silent and he has some good then we'd have to reject the refutations of salaf regarding mubtadi’yoon of their time and would undermine the deen. The scholars as a whole fulfill the trust placed upon them.*

# ‘Ilm ul-kalam

Those things which clash with islam and try to undermine it are of types and kalam is one of them.

You will no truly understand salafiyyah unless we understand what happened during first 200 years after hijrah.

When Islam spread there were other nations which were present. Tabi’een didn’t take knowledge from these people. These people had ideologies and sciences. 
Aristotle was the greatest philosopher those people. Jews and Christians because of their inferiority complex inherited the language of Aristotle and his ideas and spoke about Allah using the kalam.
Like rabbis were saying that torah is created.

In 2nd century was ja’d bin dirham and he picked up the langauge of aristotle.

Idea: everything is a jism

So he began saying that Allah is not a jism. They were trying to argue the atheists using their language. **You cannot use the language of the people of falsehood to refute them.**

They tried to prove that Allah exists but using their language. So they had to stick to implications of their language. So they said anything with attributes is created. hence they denied the attributes of Allah azza wa jal. Ja’d and Jahm brought this bi’dah into islam.

This moved to the mu’tazilah.

This then moved to kullabiyyah. They denied some attributes.

Then to ashaairah. 

They added new false principles to support the bid’ah.

1. Like we don’t accept aahaad hadeeth for Allah’s attributes. Mu’tazilah invented this.

2. Majaaz and haqeeqi - allegorical and really intended - to deny attributes. 

3. Everything is either a body or an attribute. So attribute has to be created and brought into existence and it came to be after not being so that the body itself has to be created. They distorted the words like Ahad.

In order to prevent an ideological attack they fell into another ideological attack.

(iqtisaad fil i’tiqaad - hafiz abdul ghani)Those who deny the ahadeeth of attributes or cast doubt on the narrators. They are more harmful than kuffar upon Islam

No Muslim or most won’t be affected by the ideological attack of kuffar but when mubtadi’ah come and say that this is from Islam then Muslims becomes befooled.

# Past 200 years

In the 4th century of islam this group came along which introduced grave worship into islam - batiniyyah / islamaeelis. This was the beginning of when shirk entered the ummah properly.

as it is a rule in Allah’s shariah - when you abandon tawheed Allah makes you experience hunger and poverty.

> 16:112
وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًۭا قَرْيَةًۭ كَانَتْ ءَامِنَةًۭ مُّطْمَئِنَّةًۭ يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَدًۭا مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍۢ فَكَفَرَتْ بِأَنْعُمِ ٱللَّهِ فَأَذَٰقَهَا ٱللَّهُ لِبَاسَ ٱلْجُوعِ وَٱلْخَوْفِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَصْنَعُونَ

> And Allâh puts forward the example of a township (Makkah), that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the Favours of Allâh (with ungratefulness). So Allâh made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear, because of that (evil, i.e. denying Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) which they (its people) used to do.

Around 1700-1800 we saw the era of colonialism. These western nations began to make this attack against the muslim lands. This is from asbaab-shar’iah. In the 20th century the sufi ottoman state was finished. Some people came along and saw the decline in muslim ummah and saw that the sufi state has ended. They saw the russian revolution and the experience of european nation and what the philosophers had been writing. When they tried to change this situation, they used the concepts of kuffar just like the ahlul-kalam of old did. They are Hasan al-Banna, Mawdudi, Syed Qutb, Taqi-ud-deen Nabahani. In the early part of their life they were socialist or marxist or ba’thist. They introduced this poison to Islam. Two major Slogans:

1. jaahilliyah - we see that there is no Islam present on the state of this earth as there is no muslim state according to them. This idea was of Syed Qutb.
2. unity - al-jamaa’ah. They don’t use the word as messenger sallahu alayhi wa sallam did.
 نتعاون فيما اتفقنا عليه، ويعذر بعضنا بعضا فيما اختلفنا فيه - 
basic common denominator is la ialaha illa Allah so unite with the rafidah and jahmiyyah.

## jahilliyyah branch

1. Around this idea of jaahiliyyah we saw other innovations like hakimiyyah. They wanted to make the issue of rulership the most fundamental aspect of tawheed. 
2. Another was that the obedience to the ruler is when he follows sharee’ah 100%.
3. Likewise, they began to spread the mistakes of ruler.
4. Mistakes in takfeer
5. Take part in siyasah

## seven core topics in the books of salaf

1. a clarification of the correct aqeedah
2. stressing the importance of sticking to the sunnah
3. stick to the manhaj of the salaf
4. to abandon all newly introduced things - ibdaa’
5. to abandon its people as well 
6. to not rebel against the rulers
7. to stick to the jamaa’h - be united upon the sunnah

These affairs are such important part of islam that when someone comes along now in the 20th century and opposes these usul we know straightaway that he’s misguided.

These people are originally ashaa’irah and mu;tazilah. They are descendants of the ahlul-kalam of old. 

## jamaa’ah - hasan al-banna’s branch

unite in what we agree upon and forgive what we disagree upon.

This means to speak against falsehood, which is a principle in the quran, is wrong and we remain silent in the face of kufr, ilhaad, and bid’ah. This in essence is a destruction of the religion.

Sometimes we may have a bi’dah which may be evil but its effect is limited. But there’s another bid’ah with apparently less evil content but more dangerous effects. Like this bid’ah opens the door to what’s worse. This is what happened the jews and christians. This is the tabdeel.

## next wave

Salman al-Awdah, Adnan ‘Arur, AbdurRahman AbdulKhaliq.

They see mawdudi, Hasan al-Banna and Syed Qutb have been criticised. They intorduce al-muwazanah - if you refute someone you have mention their good. This is a great baatil. Allah azaa wa jal didn’t do this in the quran. The sahaabah didn’t. Nor those who followed them.

Salman al-Awdah started differentiating between taa’ifah al-mansoorah and firqah-an-naajiyah

AbdurRahman AbdulKhaliq: ta’adud al-jama’aat is something good.

Adnan Arur: nusahhih wa laa nujarih: we correct the mistake but dont make jarh

First level was abolition of criticism. Next wave is doing neutralization.

## third group

Ma’ribi, Halabi, 

Ma’ribi: takfeeri from egypt who spent some time with some scholars.

His principles:

1. at-tathabut: verification. but this principle wasn’t present with the salaf. Like when Imam Ahmad criticized husain al-karabeesee everyone abandoned him.
2. al-mujmal wal-mufassal: If we find some statement from a person we should search for other statements to look at in the positive light. the reason he invented this principle was that qutb was being refuted by ulama for statements of kufr. 

Halabi:

1. before we accept the cirticism of any ‘aalim their must be ijmaa’
2. la-yalzimu-ni: ijamaa’ before accepting the tabdee’.

This is the greatest and most evil of ibdaa’ in the history of Islam. What Shaykh Rabee’ has done in this age is comparable to what Imam Ahmad did back then.

**These people above are the ghulaat al-murjiah as they say that a man can proclaim salafiyyah and can never ever leave salafiyyah.**
